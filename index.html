        <h3>A Dog Day Afternoon</h3>
        <p>Did you know that owning a pet may reduce blood pressure as effectively as maintaining a low-salt diet? Fido and Fluffy bring both health and happiness to their proud owners, and now there’s a place to give a little something back in return. PawsWay, located at Toronto’s Harbourfront Centre, is Canada’s first and only pet-discovery centre. Owners and their four-legged friends can play in the interactive exhibits and learn some new tricks courtesy of the centre’s educational activities. Admission to the 16,000-square-foot centre is free, though some programs may charge a small fee. Past pet programs have shown owners how to read dog and cat body language, offered tips on pet-proofing before bringing home a puppy or kitten, and presented canine freestyle "dancing." The centre also houses the Purina Animal Hall of Fame, which honours Canadian pets and service animals for savings human life. 416-360-PAWS (7297), 245 Queen’s Quay West.</p>
